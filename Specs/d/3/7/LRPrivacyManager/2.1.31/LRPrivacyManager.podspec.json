  "description": "Consent under the GDPR needs to be freely given, explicit, granular and as easy to withdraw as to give. The Privacy Manager, Faktorâ€™s Consent Management Platform (CMP) for mobile apps enables app owners to manage consent in a way that can comply to the GDPR and gives their visitors the ability to change their data preferences at any time. The consent status can be easily communicated to all vendors of an app owner as the CMP can do both, communicating with custom vendors, as well as reaching out to all the vendors participating in the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework.",
